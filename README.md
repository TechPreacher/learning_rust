# Learning Rust

This repository documents my journey learning the Rust programming language. It contains a collection of examples demonstrating various Rust concepts and features.

## Project Structure

Each example is structured as a separate binary that can be run individually:

- `arrays_vectors` - Basic examples of arrays, vectors, and simple operations
- `functional_flavored` - Examples of functional programming concepts in Rust (closures, iterators)

## Running Examples

To run an example:

```bash
cargo run --bin arrays_vectors
cargo run --bin functional_flavored
```

## Key Concepts Covered

- Strong static typing
- Immutability by default
- Ownership and borrowing
- Arrays and vectors
- Functional programming features
- Closures and iterators
- Ranges and slices
